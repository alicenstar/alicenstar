# Hi, I’m Star! 👋👩‍💻

I'm a self-taught developer who loves building full stack projects with React, TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, and Django. Currently looking for my first development job and to contribute to more open source projects!

#### 📚 I’m currently working on adding new features to my projects.✨

#### 🛠 My most recent projects are:

- [Coin Tracker](https://cointracker.me/) [ [Front end](https://github.com/alicenstar/coin-tracker-3-client) / [Back end](https://github.com/alicenstar/coin-tracker-3-api) ]
- [GitHub User Search](https://github.com/alicenstar/gh-user-search)

#### 💃 When I'm not coding you can find me:

* _Playing Animal Crossing_ 🍃
* _Sewing, drawing, painting, macrame-ing, or creating in some other medium!_ 🎨🧵
* _Walking, hiking, missing the mountains_ 🌄
